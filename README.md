# Udacity Project 2

The second project submitted for the Data Analysis Nanodegree of Udacity. It consist of an in-depth application of the wrangling process.

## Project description
Data has been collected from three (03) different sources as requested by the project:

- The first table was loaded from a csv file downloaded from the Udacity website.
- The second table was programmatically downloaded using the requests library then loaded as a .tsv file.
- For the last table, we had to create a Twitter Developer account and retrieve the data using Twitterâ€™s Tweepy API.

The next step consists of both visual and programmatic assessments.

We end with a detailled cleaning process
